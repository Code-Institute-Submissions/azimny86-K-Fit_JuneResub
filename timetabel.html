                        <h3>Olymic and Folkstyle Wrestling</h3>
                        <p>Wrestling is an ancient martial art that uses grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins, and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, generally between two people, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. Wrestling is one of the oldest of martial arts with references to it as early as the Iliad that recounts the Trojan War in the 13th or 12th century BC. There is a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.</p>

                    <p>NOGI grappling is also referred to as “Submission Grappling” and can be quite a different experience from GI training. To begin with, it’s a faster “game”. Without the “grips” or the ability to hold onto the opponents’ gi, he can slip out of positions and submissions more easily. Because of this, NOGI training helps the student get very good at holding positions and submissions. Of course the converse is also true, GI training helps the student understand how to defend against positions and submissions that he would otherwise be able to slip out of with the lack of friction and “handles” that the gi provides. Next, NOGI creates more opportunities for transitions and therefore a faster “flow” in the training. Again, it is important to train with the GI and without in order to get the benefits that each style can offer. Beginners have the most to benefit from GI training because they can slow the action down by learning to use grips as they are progressing. Some people find the GI restrictive or uncomfortable for this reason but that is exactly the benefit! On the other hand, NOGI training emphasizes submissions and tight body control in order to defeat an opponent.</p>
